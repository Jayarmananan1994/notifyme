# Epic 3: Smart Rule Engine & Content Analysis

**Epic Goal:** Build intelligent rule configuration system with sender/keyword filtering and basic content analysis for urgency detection, enabling users to customize what notifications they receive.

## Story 3.1: Basic Rule Data Model

As a developer,
I want to create database schema and models for monitoring rules,
so that users can configure and persist their notification preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Database schema created for user rules (sender patterns, keywords, conditions)
2. Rule model with proper relationships to user accounts
3. Basic CRUD operations for rule management
4. Rule validation logic to prevent invalid configurations
5. Database migrations and seed data for testing

## Story 3.2: Sender-Based Filtering Rules

As a user,
I want to create rules based on email sender information,
so that I receive notifications only from specific people or domains.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Rule configuration for exact email addresses
2. Domain pattern matching (e.g., "@company.com")
3. Display name pattern matching
4. Multiple sender conditions with OR logic
5. Rule testing interface to validate sender matches

## Story 3.3: Content-Based Filtering Rules

As a user,
I want to create rules based on email subject and content keywords,
so that I receive notifications for specific topics or urgent content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Subject line keyword matching with case-insensitive search
2. Email body keyword scanning (metadata only)
3. Boolean logic support (AND, OR) for multiple keywords
4. Priority keyword detection (urgent, deadline, payment, etc.)
5. Content rule testing with sample email data

## Story 3.4: Smart Content Analysis Engine

As the system,
I want to automatically detect urgency indicators and deadlines in emails,
so that I can prioritize notifications and provide contextual information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Basic NLP pattern matching for date/deadline extraction
2. Urgency keyword scoring (critical, urgent, deadline, ASAP)
3. Domain authority scoring (government, financial institutions prioritized)
4. Sender reputation scoring based on previous interactions
5. Combined urgency score calculation for notification prioritization

# Epic 1: Foundation & Gmail Integration

**Epic Goal:** Establish core project foundation with Gmail OAuth authentication and real-time email monitoring capabilities, delivering a basic health-check system that proves the Gmail API integration works reliably.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured monorepo with frontend/backend structure and CI/CD pipeline,
so that I can develop and deploy the application reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo structure created with `/frontend`, `/backend`, and `/shared` directories
2. Package.json files configured with appropriate dependencies (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
3. Development scripts set up for concurrent frontend/backend development
4. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured for Render/Railway deployment
5. Health check endpoints implemented and accessible

## Story 1.2: Gmail OAuth Authentication

As a user,
I want to securely authenticate with my Gmail account,
so that the application can access my email for monitoring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Gmail OAuth 2.0 integration implemented with read-only email scope
2. OAuth callback handling with proper error management
3. User session management with secure token storage
4. Clear permission explanation screen before OAuth redirect
5. Authentication success/failure feedback to user

## Story 1.3: Basic Gmail API Integration

As a developer,
I want to establish Gmail API connectivity and basic email fetching,
so that I can verify the integration works before building complex features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Gmail API client properly configured with authenticated user credentials
2. Basic email list retrieval functionality (latest 10 emails)
3. Email metadata extraction (sender, subject, date, read status)
4. API rate limit handling and error recovery
5. Basic logging system for API interactions

## Story 1.4: Gmail Webhook Setup

As the system,
I want to receive real-time notifications when new emails arrive,
so that I can process them immediately without polling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Gmail push notification subscription configured for user's inbox
2. Webhook endpoint created to receive Gmail notifications
3. Webhook signature verification for security
4. Basic email processing triggered by webhook events
5. Fallback polling mechanism if webhooks fail

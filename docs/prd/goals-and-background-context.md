# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable professionals to never miss time-sensitive emails through immediate WhatsApp alerts
- Ensure users who check email infrequently (2-5 times daily) never miss critical communications
- Achieve 90%+ user satisfaction that critical communications reach them within 5 minutes
- Validate product-market fit with 10 engaged users using the service for 30+ days

## Background Context

Digital professionals now receive 50-120+ emails daily, with the volume increasing 40% since remote work adoption. Critical communications - policy updates, payment deadlines, compliance notices - routinely get buried, causing real business consequences like missed opportunities and regulatory violations.

Current solutions fail because email filters are static, push notifications lack context, and users have shifted their immediate attention to WhatsApp/messaging platforms while treating email as asynchronous. The fundamental mismatch is that urgent communications still arrive via email, but users monitor mobile messaging for immediate attention.

The market timing is optimal: WhatsApp Business API maturity, Gmail API stability, and proven user behavior patterns around mobile-first communication monitoring.

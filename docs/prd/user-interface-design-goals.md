# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, minimalist interface focused on rule configuration efficiency. The product succeeds when users can quickly set up monitoring rules and then forget about the interface - primary interaction happens through WhatsApp notifications, not the web app. Design should feel trustworthy and professional given the sensitive email access permissions required.

## Key Interaction Paradigms  
- **Rule-based configuration** - Simple form-driven setup with preview capabilities
- **One-time setup, ongoing value** - Front-load complexity during initial configuration for long-term passive benefit
- **Mobile-responsive but desktop-optimized** - Rule creation likely happens on desktop, monitoring happens on mobile
- **Notification-centric design** - Dashboard serves monitoring rules, not daily engagement

## Core Screens and Views
- **Login/OAuth Screen** - Gmail authentication with clear permission explanations
- **Dashboard** - Overview of active rules, recent notifications, system status
- **Rule Configuration** - Create/edit monitoring rules with sender, keyword, and content parameters
- **Notification History** - Log of sent WhatsApp alerts for user review and debugging
- **Settings Page** - WhatsApp number management, notification preferences, account settings

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target compliance for professional accessibility standards without over-engineering for MVP phase.

## Branding
Clean, professional aesthetic that builds trust for email permission grants. Avoid flashy colors or casual design elements. Consider healthcare/financial service visual language - conservative but modern.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop/laptop for initial rule setup, responsive design for mobile review and management.

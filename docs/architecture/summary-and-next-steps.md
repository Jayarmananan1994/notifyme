# Summary and Next Steps

This technical architecture document provides a comprehensive foundation for building NotifyMe with the following key characteristics:

## Architecture Highlights

1. **Cost-Optimized Design**: Stays within the $10/month budget using free tiers and pay-per-use services
2. **Monolith with Service Boundaries**: Enables future microservices migration while maintaining development simplicity
3. **Production-Ready Patterns**: Includes security, monitoring, error handling, and reliability patterns
4. **Developer Experience**: Optimized for solo development with clear separation of concerns

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation (Epic 1)**
- Set up monorepo with TypeScript configuration
- Implement Gmail OAuth and basic API integration
- Deploy basic infrastructure on Railway/Render
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

**Phase 2: Core Functionality (Epics 2-3)**
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Message queue and notification delivery
- Rule engine with database schema
- Content analysis and urgency detection

**Phase 3: User Interface (Epic 4)**
- React frontend with rule configuration
- Dashboard and notification history
- User management and settings

**Phase 4: Production Readiness**
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening and compliance
- Load testing and scalability preparation

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL with Supabase**: Provides relational data integrity with generous free tier
2. **Node.js/Express**: Familiar stack with excellent Gmail API support
3. **Event-driven architecture**: Webhook-based email processing for real-time response
4. **Encryption at rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive user data
5. **Circuit breaker patterns**: Reliable external API integration

This architecture supports the MVP requirements while establishing patterns that will scale with the product's growth. The modular design within the monolith allows for future extraction of services as the system grows.

The next step is to begin implementation starting with Epic 1, following the development workflow and infrastructure patterns outlined in this document.

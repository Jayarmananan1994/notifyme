## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the foundation story.

### Architecture Context
**Monolith Architecture with Logical Separation** [Source: architecture/1-system-architecture-overview.md#1.2]
- The system follows a monolith design with clear service boundaries
- Services include: Auth Service, Email Service, Notification Service, User Service, Rule Service, Analytics Service
- This allows for future microservices migration if needed

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/1-system-architecture-overview.md#1.1]
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite build system
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase (free tier: 500MB)
- Message Queue: Memory-based (future Redis option via Upstash)
- External APIs: Gmail API, WhatsApp Business API

**Infrastructure Design** [Source: architecture/2-infrastructure-design.md#2.1]
- Hosting: Railway/Render free tier OR Vercel Frontend + Railway Backend
- Target monthly cost: $5-10/month
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL free tier
- Optional Redis: Upstash Redis free tier (10K commands)

### Development Workflow Requirements
**Build System Configuration** [Source: architecture/8-development-workflow-and-cicd.md#8.1]
- Must use Turbo for monorepo build orchestration
- Vite for frontend builds
- TypeScript compilation for backend
- Support for concurrent development mode

**Package Management** [Source: architecture/8-development-workflow-and-cicd.md#8.1]
- Root package.json must define workspace configuration
- Frontend package.json: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend package.json: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, database drivers
- Shared dependencies managed at workspace root level

### Deployment Requirements
**CI/CD Pipeline** [Source: architecture/8-development-workflow-and-cicd.md#8.2]
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Railway/Render deployment configuration
- Environment variable management for different deployment stages
- Automated health checks post-deployment

**Health Check Implementation** [Source: architecture/9-error-handling-and-reliability-patterns.md#9.3]
- Backend must expose `/health` endpoint with system status
- Frontend should display deployment and system health status
- Health checks must verify database connectivity and external API status

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework Configuration** [Source: architecture/8-development-workflow-and-cicd.md]
- Backend: Jest with TypeScript support
- Frontend: Vitest (Vite-native testing)
- Test files located adjacent to source files
- Unit tests required for core utilities and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows (future story)

**Test Structure Requirements**
- Backend tests: `src/**/*.test.ts`
- Frontend tests: `src/**/*.test.ts` or `src/**/*.test.tsx`
- Test utilities in respective `utils/test` directories
- Mock configurations for external APIs during testing
